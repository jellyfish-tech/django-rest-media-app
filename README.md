media-sdk
====================

1. DO NOT add this to INSTALLED_APPS settings

         Use it just like common lib

2. Include the polls URLconf in your project urls.py like this

         pass yet

3. In settings.py

    3.1. You should set up MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL to be able to retrieve files.

    3.2. STORAGE_OPTIONS - is your main settings dict for all your media models.
        It has next structure:
   
         STORAGE_OPTIONS = {
             <field tag>: {
                 'driver': <name of prefered driver>, ['local' #1, 's3' #2, 'tus' #3]
                 'configs': {
                     'location': <see explanation below>, [1,2]
                     'default': <path for default value>, [1]
                     'bucket': <your bucket name>, [2]
                     'name_uuid_len': <int. len of "coded" prefix of file>, [1,2,3]
                     'url': <server url>, [3]
                     'chunk_size': <int>, [3]
                     'headers': <headers dict to include in requests>, [3]
                     'rename_tries': <amount of tries to rename file before increasing uuid len int>, [3]
                     'storing_file': <name of the storing uploads urls str>, [3]
                     'retries': <amount of times to reconect int>, [3]
                     'retry_delay': <delay in ms between reconect tries int>, [3]
                     'upload_checksum': <turning the cheksum bool>, [3]
                 }
             },
             <field tag>: {...}
         }

        EXPLANATIONS:

            location - is a callable object, get one pos arg (pure name of file) and it can get named args with default vals,
            and return path for storing this file e.g:
            
            def create_location(name, request=None):
                from datetime import datetime
                now = datetime.now()
                name = f"EXAMPLES/{now.year}/{now.month}/{now.day}/{"{request.user}/" if request}{name}"
                return name

6. How to use

      In yoyr models.py
         
         from media_sdk import Media, GenericFileField

      In your model class
   
         1. Inherite from Media class
         2. Create field GenericFileField

         GenericFileField takes one special arg "tag" [<field tag> in configs see above]
         and all other args as common FileField class does.

      Functions:
      
      Each method has it's own doc string
   
         Module provides functions for comfortable saving:
         
            from media_sdk import save_file, save_multy_files

            save_file - will be usefull in case of saving only one file.
   
            save_multy_files - will be usefull in case of saving multiple files.
               It has a more complex argument structure and requires precise names.

7. Cautions

         Notice one thing. Methods presented above, have "upload_to" property. 
         Be careful using this property and admin panel.
         Admin panel - defines location for saving using "location" setting (see STORAGE_OPTIONS above).
         While using provided methods, you also use this setting, difference is adding "upload_to"
         property to the path.
         So, there are two ways to salve it:
            1) Not use "upload_to" property in this methods, and just add it in the "location" setting.
            2) Use only methods, and not admin panel.

         Default imagese re protected from deleting and updating. Notice, in case you
         will change 'default' value in settings, if either deletion or updating occur, 
         previous default value - will be removed (physically).
   
   

8. EXAMPLES
   
   Normal save and update

      'my_app/models.py'
   
         from media_sdk import Media, GenericFileField
   
         class MyModel(Media):
            my_file1 = GenericFileField(tag='file1_tag')  # let's consider this is for admin needs
            my_file2 = GenericFileField(tag='file2_tag')  # and this is for user, and admin do not have access (or have, but not change [Cautions])
            ...other fields are free for use...

      'my_app/views.py'

         from media_sdk import save_file, save_multy_files
         from .models import MyModel

         def creating_my_model(request):
            # PART FOR STORING
            files = request.FILES
            file_for_my_file_field_1 = files['file1']
            file_for_my_file_field_2 = files['file2']
            
            fields_data = {
              'file1_tag': {
                  'name': file_for_my_file_field_1.name,
                  'content': file_for_my_file_field_1,
                  'upload_to': '' [carefully read Cautions part above]
              },
              'file2_tag': {
                  'name': file_for_my_file_field_2.name,
                  'content': file_for_my_file_field_2,
                  'upload_to': f'{request.user}' [carefully read Cautions part above]
              },
            }
            saved_model_instance = save_multy_files(MyModel, fields_data)  # [see func doc strings]
            # END

         def updating_my_model(request, pk):  # for example, updating will be only for user's file
            # PART FOR STORING 
            files = request.FILES
            file_for_my_file_field_2 = files['file2']
            data = {
               'filename': file_for_my_file_field_2.name,
               'content': file_for_my_file_field_2,
               'tag': 'file2_tag',
               'upload_to': f'{request.user}'
            }
            updated_and_saved_model_instance = save_file(Senen, **data)
            # END

   Creating with default value

         In case of providing empty 'content', field will consider use
         'default' field of <field tag>'s configs, if it exists, otherwise 
         behaviour will be common.
